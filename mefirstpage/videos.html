    					<h3>Mointains is something unbelieviable</h3>
    					<p>If you are faced with a mountain, you have several options. You can climb it and cross to the other side. You can go around it. You can dig under it. You can fly over it. You can blow it up. You can ignore it and pretend it is not there. You can turn around and go back the way you came. Or you can stay on the mountain and make it your home. </p>

    					<h3>Just see it</h3>
    					<p>Since I remember I have always been in love with the mountains. They have always been with me, even in my earliest childhood. I know people who fell in love with mountains in their adult life. I had a privilege to be taught that by my father. But  be aware  as Irish say: marry a mountain girl and you marry the whole mountain. Enjoy!</p>
